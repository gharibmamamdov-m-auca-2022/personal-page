            <p>
                 Cats are small, carnivorous mammals that belong to the Felidae family.
                 Known for their agility, sharp claws, and keen senses, 
                 they are popular pets due to their independent nature, affectionate behavior, and playful personalities.
                 Cats have a strong hunting instinct, often chasing after small prey or toys. 
                 Their grooming habits keep them clean, and their purring is a sign of contentment
